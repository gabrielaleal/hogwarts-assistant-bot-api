# Hogwarts Assistant Bot API

This project was made for the Intelligent Systems discipline of UFPE's Informatic Center.

## First steps
:bangbang: You must have [Python 3.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) installed in your machine.

After you clone this repository, run the following commands:

1. To install everything you need:
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

2. To run your application:
```python3 app.py```


Now your app is running and you just need to access the given local url! (The one after ''Running on...'')
